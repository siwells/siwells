### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Simon wells a lecturer in the School of Computing at Edinburgh Napier University in Scotland. This is just one of my "homes on the web" where I collect together some of the work that I do. Mostly that work involves computers and programming. When getting away from the screen, I play with synths (mostly Moog, Arturia, & Elektron gear), read (mostly sci-fi with a focus on classic/golden age although I keep up with many of the newer writers as well), and listen to music (mostly jazz with a focus on Coltrane, Mingus, Monk, and Sanders).
